# cv-v5

Version 5 of my CV, complete redesign and rebuild. While I was happy with the previous version from a technical standpoint the design was very dated looking, so I have updated
it with more of a magazine article feel, lots of clean lines, lots of whitespace. Little bit of animation - room for improvement on this but looks quite cool.
